<p>The project aims to develop a facility for customers <br>
        to order pizzas from a pizza shop </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The goal of the project is to apply different <br>
            algorithms and data structures.</li> 
        <li>The project is implemented using oop concepts also.</li>
        <li> A customer can view the menu card, select <br>
            the pizzas of his choice and place an order <br>
            for home delivery.</li>
        <li>While placing the order, a customer needs to <br>
            enter personal details and the delivery location.</li>
        <li>If the mobile number of a customer is already<br>
            registered with the shop, all the details are <br>
            automatically fetched. <br> </li>
        <li>The customer has the option of using the same <br>
            registered address or entering a new one.</li>
        <li>Our system finds the shortest path to <br>
            the customerâ€™s location and saves this shortest distance.</li>
        <li>The estimated delivery time and delivery charges <br>
            are calculated based on the shortest distance <br>
            and displayed to the customer.</li>
        <li>Delivery charges are added to the cost of <br>
            ordered pizzas and the total bill amount is displayed.</li>
        <li>The customer can confirm his order and pay <br>
            the bill amount or can cancel the current order.</li>
    </ul>
